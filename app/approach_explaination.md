Intelligent Document Analyzer – Methodology
In today’s world of information overload, we built the Intelligent Document Analyzer to help users quickly extract the most relevant insights from long, unstructured PDFs — all based on who they are and what they need to achieve. 📄✨

This solution is built with speed, accuracy, and offline usability in mind — making it perfect for constrained environments like Docker containers with no internet, no GPU, and strict time limits.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. 🔍 PDF Parsing & Structure Detection
We begin by parsing each PDF using PyMuPDF. Instead of treating text as one big blob, we analyze:

Font sizes

Text positioning

Line spacing

Boldness

This helps us detect and label document structure like TITLE, H1, H2, and paragraphs — preserving the hierarchy and flow of the document.

2. 📚 Intelligent Chunking
Each document is split into meaningful chunks, along with metadata like:

Document name

Page number

Heading (if detected)

This lets us keep context intact and trace each insight back to its source 📌.

3. 🤖 Embedding with bge-small
We use the compact and efficient bge-small model to turn each chunk into a semantic vector (embedding). It’s lightweight (~100MB), CPU-friendly, and performs semantic search locally without needing the cloud. ☁️🚫

We also embed the user’s role and job-to-be-done prompt, and compute cosine similarity between the user intent and all content chunks.

4. 🎯 Top-K Scoring & Filtering
Based on the similarity scores, we select the most relevant 10–20 chunks. These are the golden nuggets 🏆 — the parts of the documents that actually matter to the user.

5. ✨ Summarization with phi-2
To give users quick, readable takeaways, we summarize each top chunk using the phi-2 model (run locally via Ollama). It's compact, fast, and generates focused summaries — ideal for offline summarization 📝⚡.

6. 📦 Final Output
We output a structured JSON with:

✅ Document name & page

✅ Heading or title

✅ Relevance score

✅ Final summary

This can be plugged into UIs, dashboards, or used as-is to power intelligent search or recommendations.
